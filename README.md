# CognoRise-Infotech-Task-2
During my internship at CognoRise Infotech, as my second task, I developed a Library Management System in Java. It included a `Book` class with attributes like title, author, and status, and a `LibraryCatalog` class for managing books. The system allowed adding, searching, checking out, and returning books using an `ArrayList`.
